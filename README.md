#Task: Add Reminders
This initial version of the app have all the components of the architecture implemented. However, it is currently only deals with Notes.

Your task is to extend this app to include reminders. You can start with creating an Activity that shows a list of all reminders. Then move on to building out the service components (Intent Processors, Adapters, etc) to bring data from the network.

You can look at how the classes related to Notes are built. The classes that will implement Reminders should be very similar the classes that implement Notes.

Also, you can follow the design shown in slide 17 of the presentation as a guide to build out the Reminders.
